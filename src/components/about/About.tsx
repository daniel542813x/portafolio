                        Always I was curious about how the things work, for this reason, I break many things in my
                        house equally I was fixing then, for example some days 
                        I add a new chip sim card to my phone this was a challenge for me because I don`t have 
                        the best tools for this, but I did it, and Works perfectly.

                        Also, I have skills in leadership, teamwork, and communication developed through
                        many years even before my university studies because I start my leadership when
                        I was 10 years old in my school and I was the leader of my class for each year and president 
                        of the student on my least year of high school. In my university, I was recognized as a leader
                        until the end.
